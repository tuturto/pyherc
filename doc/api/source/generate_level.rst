Generating a level
******************
This section will have a look at level generation, how different parts of the
software work together to create a new level and how to add new levels into
the game.

Overview of generating dungeon
==============================
Dungeon is used to represent playing area of the game. It contains levels which
player can explore.

Dungeon is generated by :class:`pyherc.generators.dungeon.DungeonGenerator` The
class itself is quite hard coded and does not need any configuration. Currently
it starts by generating catacombs, where the game starts.

.. code-block:: python

    model.dungeon = Dungeon()
    generator = CatacombsLevelGenerator(self.action_factory)
    level = generator.generate_level(None, model, 1)
    model.dungeon.levels = level

:class:`pyherc.generators.level.catacombs.CatacombsLevelGenerator` has
responsibility to both create catacombs and ensure levels accessed from
catacombs are generated as well. It is recommended that other portions of the
dungeon are linked via proxies in portals.

Adding a new type of level
==========================
Adding a new level is quite straightforward procedure, when you know what
you are doing. Following section will give a rough idea how it can be
accomplished.

Level generator
---------------
In order to add a new type of level into the game, a level generator needs to
be written first. It has a simple interface:

.. code-block:: python
    
    def generate_level(self, portal, model, new_portals = 0, level=1, room_min_size = (2, 2))

Arguments supplied to this function are:

  * portal - Portal at an existing level, where this level should be connected
  * model - Model instance being used
  * new_portals - Amount of portals to be generated and placed on new level
  * level - deepness of the level
  * room_min_size - Minimum size of the rooms to generate. This parameter will
    most likely be removed in the future

Shape of the level
++++++++++++++++++
One of the first things for our level generator to do, is to create a new 
Level object:

.. code-block:: python

    new_level = Level((80, 40), tiles.FLOOR_ROCK, tiles.WALL_GROUND)

This call will instantiate a Level object, set it size to be 80 times 40, 
create floor of rock and fill the whole level will ground wall. After this the
generator can create structure of the level as wanted.

.. code-block:: python

    for y_loc in range(1, 39):
        for x_loc in range(1, 79):
            new_level.walls[x_loc][y_loc] = tiles.WALL_EMPTY

Adding monsters
+++++++++++++++           
No level is complete without some monsters. Next we will add a single rat:

.. code-block:: python

    monster = self.creature_generator.generate_creature(
                                            model.tables, {'name':'rat'})
    new_level.add_creature(monster, new_level.find_free_space())

This will instruct :class:`pyherc.generators.creature.CreatureGenerator` to
use supplied monster tables and create a monster called 'rat'. After this,
the rat is added at a random free location.

Adding items
++++++++++++
Our brave adventurer needs items to loot. Following piece of code will add a
single random food item:

.. code-block:: python

    new_item = self.item_generator.generateItem(model.tables, {'type':'food'})
    new_item.location = new_level.find_free_space()
    new_level.items.append(new_item)

This will instruct :class:`pyherc.generators.item.ItemGenerator` to use 
supplied item tables and create random food type item. After this the item
is added to the level. This portion of the Level interface will most likely
change in the future, to match better to the interface used to add monsters.

Linking to previous level
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
Our level is almost ready, we still need to link it to level above it. This
is done using the Portal object, that was passed to this generator in the
beginning:

.. code-block:: python

    if portal != None:
        new_portal = Portal()
        new_portal.model = model
        new_level.add_portal(new_portal, new_level.find_free_space(), portal)

First we create a new Portal and link it to our Model. Then we add it to the
new level at random location and link it to portal on a previous level.
        
Linking to further levels
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
If you want to this dungeon branch to continue further, you can create new
Portal objects, place them on the level and repeat the process above to
generate level.

Another option is to use proxy level generators, that will cause levels to
be generated at the moment when somebody tries to walk through portal to enter
them.

Adding level into the dungeon
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Now you have a generator that can be used to generate new levels. Last step
is to modify an existing level generator to place a portal and create a level
using this new generator. If that step is skipped, new type of levels will
never get generated.
